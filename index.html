    <section id="about" class="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>A dedicated Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student with a diverse professional background that spans across multiple industries. While I'm passionate about technology and its transformative power, my career journey so far has been shaped by roles that have honed my communication, problem-solving, and leadership skills.</p>
        <p>I’ve had the opportunity to work in various capacities, starting as a Customer Service Representative, where I developed strong interpersonal and customer support skills, learning the importance of empathy, effective communication, and patience. As a Subject Matter Expert, I refined my analytical thinking and training abilities, empowering others with the knowledge to excel in their roles. In my time as a Production Specialist, I gained a deep understanding of operational processes and learned how to work efficiently under pressure while maintaining high standards of quality. Additionally, my experience as an Assistant Admin Aide taught me about organizational skills, attention to detail, and how to support teams in achieving administrative and operational goals.</p>
        <p>Through these diverse roles, I’ve gained invaluable skills in communication, problem-solving, and leadership, which I believe complement my technical expertise in IT. I am always eager to blend my technical knowledge with my real-world experience to create solutions that not only work but also provide meaningful value to others.</p>
        <p>As I continue to pursue my degree, I am focused on applying both my professional experience and academic knowledge to the tech field, where I can contribute to innovative projects and solutions.</p>
